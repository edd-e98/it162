 <h3>Hi there, my name is Eddie!</h3>
 <p>I'm an aspiring web developer located in Seattle, WA. I began my program about a year ago, hoping to become a front-end developer. After taking some courses, I've recently become interested in back-end, database design and server administration.</p>
 <p>Outside of school, I work part-time for a small, local pottery store. Helping them re-design their website was a large part of my decision to make web development my career! We had to work with a template provided by the point-of-sales system we use, and for the most part, I was unable to edit the HTML of the page-- it was a fun challenge. You can see the end result <a href="https://www.paintthetown.studio/">here.</a></p>
 <p>I spend my spare time making art, playing DnD, and organizing drag shows with my friends. Check out the website I made for them last quarter <a href="https://www.edd-e.net/big/">here.</a></p>
